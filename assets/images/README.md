# Assets Images

This folder contains image assets for the Flutter template app.

## Required Images:

### Splash Screen
- `splash_logo.png` - Logo for splash screen (recommended size: 288x288px)
  - Currently: Placeholder file (replace with actual logo)

### Onboarding
- `onboarding_1.png` - First onboarding screen image (Welcome to Flutter Template)
  - Currently: Placeholder file (replace with welcome illustration)
- `onboarding_2.png` - Second onboarding screen image (AI-Powered Features)
  - Currently: Placeholder file (replace with AI/tech illustration)
- `onboarding_3.png` - Third onboarding screen image (Secure & Scalable)
  - Currently: Placeholder file (replace with security/cloud illustration)

## Image Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG (for transparency) or JPEG (for photos)
- **Splash Logo**: 288x288px (square format)
- **Onboarding Images**: 400x300px (landscape format recommended)
- **Density Variants**: Consider providing @2x and @3x variants for different screen densities

## Replacement Instructions:
1. Replace placeholder files with actual images
2. Ensure images are optimized for mobile devices
3. Test on different screen sizes and densities
4. Update image paths in code if filenames change

## Current Status:
✅ Placeholder files created
❌ Actual images need to be added
❌ Multiple density variants needed
